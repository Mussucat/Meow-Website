# LearnHub - Online Learning Platform

This repository contains the frontend code for LearnHub, a simple online learning platform where users can browse courses, sign up, log in, and view course details.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main landing page.
- `courses.html`: Displays all available courses.
- `course-details.html`: Shows details for a specific course.
- `login.html`: User login page.
- `signup.html`: User signup page.
- `about.html`: About Us page.
- `contact.html`: Contact Us page.
- `my-courses.html`: Page for logged-in users to see their enrolled courses (Placeholder).
- `checkout.html`: Checkout page (Placeholder).
- `privacy-policy.html`: Privacy policy page (Placeholder).
- `terms.html`: Terms of service page (Placeholder).
- `css/`: Contains the CSS stylesheets.
  - `styles.css`: Main stylesheet for the website, includes dark mode.
- `js/`: Contains JavaScript files.
  - `script.js`: (Currently empty, potentially for future interactivity).
- `images/`: Contains SVG images (currently placeholders, needs replacement).

## Features

- Responsive design for various screen sizes.
- Dark mode toggle with user preference saving (localStorage).
- Modern UI elements and styling.
- Placeholder SVG images (intended to be replaced with actual course/content images).
- Basic HTML structure for core pages.

## Getting Started

1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## TODO / Improvements

- Replace all placeholder SVG images in the `/images` directory with actual relevant images.
- Implement backend functionality for user authentication, course enrollment, payments, etc.
- Add interactivity using JavaScript (e.g., mobile menu toggle, form validation, dynamic content loading).
- Populate content for placeholder pages (`my-courses.html`, `checkout.html`, `privacy-policy.html`, `terms.html`).
- Add accessibility improvements (ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation).
